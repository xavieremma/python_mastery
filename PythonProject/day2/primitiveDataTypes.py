#data types

# we previously learned strings, now we are going to be learning integers, floats and Booleans
print("Hello"[0])
# prints "H" because that is the first character of the string (This is called subscripting)
# negative indicies are available, for example -1 is the last character of the string
"123" #is not seen as a number to the computer, but rather a piece of text

print("123" + "345") #concatenates the strings

#<--- Integer --->
# integers are whole numbers
print(123 + 345)

print(12345689) # this is equal to 123_456_789

# <--- Float --->
print(3.14159)

# <--- Boolean --->
print(True)
print(False)
