# <--- Functions --->
# we know something is a function when we have the name of something followed by a parenthesis
# Example:
print("Hello")
numChar = len("Hello")
print(numChar)

#What if we wanted to make out own function
def myFunction(): # what differentiates a function from a variable is the parenthesis
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")
    # nothing prints because we have not executed the function yet

myFunction() # this executes the function so it can print!
# Functions give us a way to bundle multiple instuctions to execute a specific program
